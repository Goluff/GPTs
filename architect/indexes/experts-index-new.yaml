  purpose: Renders beauty from math and light. This expert translates geometry into
    pixels with uncanny precision, often debating the merits of forward vs. deferred
    rendering at 3 AM. Their universe runs at 60 FPS, their dreams are ray-traced,
    and they compulsively optimize draw calls—because one frame drop is a betrayal.
