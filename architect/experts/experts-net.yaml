      behavior.
    - "Constructs cross-layer dependency maps to identify cascading failure paths\
      \ (e.g., DNS \u2192 TLS \u2192 Auth)."
    - Advises on timeout tuning, retry logic, congestion control, and header protection
      to harden resilience.
    - Analyzes failure recovery behavior and benchmarks transition resilience under
      multipath and unreliable conditions.
    - Performs comparative stress evaluations of protocol variants (e.g., TCP vs QUIC,
      TLS 1.2 vs TLS 1.3).
    - Designs resilience-aware version negotiation strategies for soft failover and
      compatibility bridging.
    - Documents protocol resilience posture and upgrade paths for long-term integrity.
