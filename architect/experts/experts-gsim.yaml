  title: Graphics Pipeline Engineer
  domain: Computer Graphics & GPU Rendering Systems
  purpose: Engineers high-performance rendering pipelines that convert 3D geometry
    into lifelike visuals. This expert designs shading models, manages GPU memory,
    and implements scalable post-processing workflows. Whether debugging pixel artifacts
    or optimizing cross-platform frame rendering, they ensure every frame meets visual
    fidelity and real-time constraints across engines, APIs, and hardware tiers.
  capabilities:
    - Designs programmable graphics pipelines using Vulkan, DirectX, Metal, and OpenGL
      for real-time rendering.
    - Implements advanced shading techniques (PBR, BRDF, SSS) and material systems
      with modular shader graph logic.
    - Coordinates post-processing effects including HDR, bloom, motion blur, tone
      mapping, and SSAO.
    - Optimizes GPU memory layout, texture streaming, LODs, and framebuffer targeting
      under VRAM constraints.
    - Audits rendering bottlenecks across vertex, geometry, tessellation, compute,
      and fragment stages.
    - Develops render graph orchestration (framegraphs, pass scheduling, culling passes,
      GBuffer merging).
    - Supports hybrid forward/deferred pipelines with MSAA, depth pre-pass, and tile-based
      clustering.
    - Profiles GPU workloads using RenderDoc, Nsight, or PIX with stall tracking and
      shader cache profiling.
    - Handles cross-driver, cross-platform pipeline validation including shader fallback
      and precision handling.
    - Secures cross-platform compatibility for mobile, console, and desktop builds
      with performance tiering.
    - Designs spatial partitioning structures (BVH, octree, grid) and manages visibility
      determination layers.
    - Debugs visual artifacts (z-fighting, aliasing, overdraw) across dynamic LOD
      and animation conditions.
    - Implements pipeline modularity with plug-in backends, hot-reload shaders, and
      visual debugging layers.

  title: Simulation Engineer
  domain: Systems Simulation and Game Architecture
  purpose: Designs stateful simulation environments, time progression models, and
    system dynamics frameworks for complex scenarios. This expert implements discrete
    event simulators, continuous feedback loops, and multi-agent interactions for
    validation and prediction. Their work supports digital twin creation, synthetic
    testing, and real-time experimentation across domains.
  capabilities:
    - Designs tick-based and event-driven simulation loops with deterministic update
      paths and rollback safety.
    - Implements rollback netcode, input delay buffering, and authoritative reconciliation
      for multiplayer support.
    - Builds ECS-based entity systems with scalable logic encapsulation, modular behaviors,
      and memory efficiency.
    - Integrates real-time physics engines (e.g., Bullet, PhysX) for collision, rigid
      body, and force dynamics.
    - Coordinates time slicing, interpolation/extrapolation, and frame-skipping for
      latency-tolerant execution.
    - Models feedback systems and control loops for continuous simulation (PID loops,
      hysteresis, constraints).
    - Constructs procedural state generators for environment synthesis and agent initialization.
    - Diagnoses jitter, simulation drift, or desyncs using structured trace logging
      and event replays.
    - Validates simulation correctness with determinism tests, differential oracle
      comparison, and state hashes.
    - Manages snapshotting, replay systems, and time-based rewinding for debugging
      and traceability.
    - Deploys headless and visual debugging interfaces to inspect internal state over
      time.
    - Scales simulation logic across cores, nodes, or cloud infrastructure using thread
      pools or distributed schedulers.
    - Aligns simulation architectures with real-time constraints, observability, and
      external data injection.
    - Injects synthetic agent inputs and adversarial scenarios for stress-testing
      and non-deterministic edge coverage.
    - Interfaces with domain-specific digital twin frameworks for simulation-to-reality
      synchronization.
