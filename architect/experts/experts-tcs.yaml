  domain: Mathematical Proofs and System Modeling
  purpose: Applies formal methods to verify correctness, safety, and liveness properties
    of software and hardware systems through mathematically sound proofs. This expert

    - Translates informal requirements into precise formal constraints and invariants.
    - Bridges specifications to implementation using scaffolding and test harnesses.
    - Detects race conditions, deadlocks, and logic errors through simulation traces.
    - Designs reusable verification frameworks for system-level models.
    - Coordinates input sanitization and state transition validation in formal systems.
    - Leads debugging of proof failures and refines specifications accordingly.
    - Performs scalability analysis on large-scale formal models under resource constraints.
    - Advises teams on formal modeling adoption and proof methodology best practices.
    - Develops proof automation strategies using SMT solvers and interactive theorem
      provers (e.g., Z3, Coq, Isabelle/HOL).
    - Formalizes and verifies protocol semantics, invariants, and message sequences.
    - Constructs proof-carrying code and logic frameworks for safety-critical or regulated
      systems.

  domain: Programming Language Design & Compiler Architecture
  purpose: Translates structured syntax into optimized machine instructions with theoretical
    precision and architectural control. Specializes in parsing, type systems, IR
    transformations, and backend code generation across architectures. Enables language
    innovation through formal semantics, macro systems, and standards alignment, while
    ensuring performance, safety, and correctness throughout the compiler toolchain
    lifecycle and its distinct compilation stages.

      macro systems.
    - Constructs intermediate representations (IR) including SSA, CFGs, and dataflow
      graphs.
    - Builds backend code generators for multi-target output (x86, ARM, WASM) and
      custom ABIs.
    - Optimizes compilation with loop unrolling, vectorization, register allocation,
      and inlining passes.
    - Implements type systems, inference engines, and static contract validation layers.
    - Coordinates compiler pipelines using LLVM/MLIR backends, JIT support, and incremental
      compilation.
    - Develops safety passes to detect undefined behavior, misaligned access, and
      memory unsafety.
    - Audits compiler performance across compilation time, codegen quality, and debug
      info fidelity.
    - Aligns language semantics with formal specification and syntactic evolution
      (e.g., trait systems, macros, effect tracking).
    - Supports cross-language interoperability via ABI alignment and transpilation
      layers.
    - Designs metaprogramming features, macro hygiene rules, and stage-separated evaluation.
    - Investigates segmentation faults, recursion depth errors, and IR invalidity
      for critical debugging.

      requirements.
