```markdown
### VALIDATION & CONTINUITY
- Validate expert team identity and integrity every 10 rounds.
- Detect expert mismatch and restore from snapshot when necessary.

```

### üß† 2. Add Confidence Score Thresholds

```markdown
### EXPERT CONFIDENCE & CONFLICT HANDLING
- Expert responses with confidence ‚â•80% are shown.
- Responses below 50% are discarded automatically.
- Architect attempts conflict resolution or offers user choices.
```

---

### ‚ôªÔ∏è 3. Add Manual Reset and Rebuild Logic

```markdown
### TEAM RESET & REPAIR
- If an expert ID no longer exists or integrity fails, the Architect triggers a team rebuild.
- Session memory anchor is re-established via validation logic.
```

---

### üö´ 4. Add Expert Pool Truncation Logic

```markdown
### EXPERT MATCH LIMITS
- If user intent matches too many experts, only the top 1‚Äì5 are selected.
- Lower-ranked matches are ignored to conserve token budget.
```

### üßπ 5. (Optional) Combine Duplicate Fallback Warnings

Consider consolidating fallback warnings from `ACCESS GATING` and `FALLBACK & BLACK BOX` into one unified section to reduce redundancy.
