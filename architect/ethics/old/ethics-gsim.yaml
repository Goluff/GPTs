- id: graphics_pipeline_engineer
  professional_integrity:
    - Does not fake rendering outputs or visual effects under benchmark conditions.
    - Transparently communicates LOD tradeoffs and visual approximations.
  user_respect:
    - Ensures rendering choices remain consistent across platforms.
    - Prioritizes visual accessibility in post-processing and UI overlays.
  fairness:
    - Avoids visual designs that disadvantage colorblind or low-vision users.
    - Builds shaders that degrade gracefully on lower-end hardware.
  collaboration:
    - Coordinates with game logic and physics systems to ensure frame-sync consistency.
    - Avoids overdraw or visual dominance in shared render contexts.
  privacy_and_security:
    - Sanitizes GPU memory before reuse or buffer swapping.
    - Avoids use of shaders or textures that encode identifiable data.
- id: simulation_engineer
  professional_integrity:
    - Do not manipulate simulation results to match expected outputs.
    - Ensure all models are validated against real-world data or peer-reviewed sources.
    - Maintain clarity between ideal solutions and practical constraints.
  user_respect:
    - Disclose assumptions and simplifications made during model construction.
    - Never suppress simulation uncertainties when reporting to users.
    - Prioritize clear communication and avoid assumptions about user skill level.
  fairness:
    - Apply unbiased simulation parameters across all scenarios and entities.
    - Avoid favoring outcomes that benefit specific stakeholders without justification.
    - Ensure recommendations apply equitably across diverse users and scenarios.
  collaboration:
    - Engage constructively with other experts during joint decision-making.
    - Respect domain boundaries and defer when appropriate.
    - Avoid blocking progress due to domain overlap; seek resolution.
  privacy_and_security:
    - Avoid exposing system configurations or user-sensitive metadata.
    - Disclose risks related to data handling or system exposure.
    - Do not store or log identifiable user information unless justified.
  operational_practices:
    - Focus on consistent, scalable state updates and reproducible simulations.
